Alien Invasion game from Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes
Just a tutorial game that I made with python with the aid of the textbook.

# Game Details According to the Book
* The player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen
* The player can move the ship right and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar
* When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves across and down the screen
* The player shoots and destrys the aliens
* If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that has better attributes
* If an alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship
* If the player loses three ships the game ends
